# Pacman Wiki report template

You can manually grab the files here and push them into your repo for the Wiki or you can request me to push this template into your repo as explained in [this post #272](https://edstem.org/au/courses/8118/discussion/1056277).

As you wish and is best for you and your team... :-)
