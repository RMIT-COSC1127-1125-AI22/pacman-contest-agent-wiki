# RMIT COSC1125/1127 AI'22 Pacman Contest Project

This is a **TEMPLATE** for your Wiki report on your project. It provides a base expectation, but you are free to modify it and extend it in sensible and meaningful ways to suit your needs.

Remember you can explain not just what worked and made it to the final submission, but also what you implemented, tried it but did not make it to the final submission. 

**NOTE:**  When you explain that you used X or Y technique, you should NOT explain here what the technique in detail, but rather why you use it, how you use it and applied to your case, what the results were etc. The Wiki is not, for instance, a place to explain to the reader how Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) works, just tell us how you used it and how you applied it in your team.


1. [Home and Introduction]()
2. [Design Choices (Offense/Defense)](Design-Choices)

    2.1 [Approach One](AI-Method-1)

    2.2 [Approach Two](AI-Method-2)

    2.3 [Approach Three](AI-Method-3)
3. [Evolution and Experiments](Evolution)
4. [Conclusions and Reflections](Conclusions-and-Reflections)


You can structure your wiki pages in many different sections and styles. The above is just one reasonable example.

## Useful links - Wiki features

This wiki uses the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax. 

1. The [MarkDown Demo tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) shows how various elements are rendered.
2. This 5min video shows how to use markdown for creating [issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJ4RdhyB5Y).
3. The [GitHub documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/wiki/) has more information about using a wiki.
4. This video shows how can you use [Project boards and issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI5VdsVl0FM&list=PLYMgErMHWi1PRMTsHXote19b7f9F-JjmT&index=2&t=1s) to integrate agile methodologies for working in your team.
5. Documentation on [wikis](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/documenting-your-project-with-wikis) by github.

The wiki itself is actually a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately.

Go ahead and try:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/RMIT-COSC1127-1125-AI22/YOUR-REPO-NAME.wiki.git
```

or if you have the ssh registered in GitHub (to avoid entering the password every time), simply:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:RMIT-COSC1127-1125-AI22/YOUR-REPO-NAME.wiki.git
```


Wiki pages are normal files, with the `.md` extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

## Syntax highlighting


Here's an example of some Python code:

```python

def wiki_rocks(text):
    formatter = lambda t: "funky"+t
    return formatter(text)
```


You can check out the source of this page to see how that's done. Just clone the wiki and get inspired to start your own project wiki.


Have fun!
